# echOpen prototyping

This book is made to bring together all information about ongoing prototyping at echOpen !!

For more details about the project and how to contribute, please read the [starter kit](https://www.gitbook.com/book/echopen/starterkit/details)

You find here the details about the echOpen laboratory prototype and all ongoing development to improve performance and image quality.

As the prototype was splitted into modules, the aim is to spread the kit in various communities to let anyone contribute in the hardware development as well as the software development.

* UPMC \(Université Pierre et Marie Curie in Paris\)
* Simon Bolivar university \(in Colombia\)
* More to come soon. 

And members of the community are working on it to make it happen !! Follow the signal...
