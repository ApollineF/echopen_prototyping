### Identify and discuss project core elements

* What are we doing ?
* With who ?
* How we do it ?

### Basics

Association: cf Association Goals

General assembly - existing big picture:

 * create a prototype with medical standards
    * medical image quality - success
    * clinical interpretability - in progress

    * clinical trials in June 2018 - to come

 * community impact - support industrial project

### Community status ?

Do we interface community with industrial project ?

How do we interface community with industrial project ?

What a contributor is looking for in echOpen project ?

How do we give values to contributors ?

How we valorize community ? competences available and contributions

Do we grow communities and how ?

What we expect from contributors ?

Which community models could be similar to ours ?

### What are the projects ?
Do we focus on a single project (industrial project) ?

If not, what are the side projects ?

**Brainstorm on projects**

### What is the roadmap ?
** Determine the milestones to complete the project/s **

### How do we find and allocate resources ?
Do we need more resources ?

### Communication ?

**Action Plan:**

 * state of the art - existing similar community models
 * Calendar of the topic we will process
 * secondary projects

 * how people get more aware of their close work group ?
    * example of the CMS community (3000 members) **@nfilipov**
    * multi layer communications - hierarchy

 * create a wish list


## Brainstorming about Challenge4Students:

 * build a RoadMap - short term / long term **@all**
     * build realistic targets
     * organize CapTech
     * define process for RoadMap creation
     * who drives this RoadMap creation ?

 * Process description **@benchoufi**
   * *as a client for the academics*
     * Provide resources to the school 
     * Follow up very important to engage and focus development **@lecoued**
     * How to integrate the deliverables ?
 
 * create a wishlist **@aurelie** **@benchoufi**

 * identify priorities

## 2017.04.10 - HD - 19.00 \(Paris time\)

attending : Jérôme D. / Benoît V. / Olivier F. / Mehdi B. / Alister T. / Aurélie M.

## Medicotechnical gitbook

* "How to contribute" section is complete, needs for beta-testing --&gt; @alister will read it and make some remarks
* Need to include Mechanics in the medicotechnical gitbook + create github repo / teams for mechanics
  * There will be two "parallel" sides of the mechanics : the one for "test bench" + the one for the real probe. In an ideal case, releases will include both. 
  * @Benoît will complete the "mechanics" section in the backlog
* "Find your team" section : add links to slack channels
* Software : 
  * development ok, needs to plug on the device to test --&gt; this will be done on wednesday
  * documentation is ongoing, will be ok by the end of the week
  * @lecoued made a huge cleaning of the code
  * next release : unit tests to be implemented
* Activity report : almost done, @benchoufi is on it :\)



## Mechanics

* @Benoit has made a prototype in polystyrene
* Due to mechanical constrains, the section related with one image won't be a perfect plan --&gt; ok for tests, but obviously not for medical applications
* need for transducers to test the encapsulation
