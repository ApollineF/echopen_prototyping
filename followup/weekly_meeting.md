# 2017

## 2017.04.10 - HD - 19.00 \(Paris time\)

attending : Jérôme D. / Benoît V. / Olivier F. / Mehdi B. / Alister T. / Aurélie M.

## Medicotechnical gitbook

* "How to contribute" section is complete, needs for beta-testing --&gt; @alister will read it and make some remarks
* Need to include Mechanics in the medicotechnical gitbook + create github repo / teams for mechanics
  * There will be two "parallel" sides of the mechanics : the one for "test bench" + the one for the real probe. In an ideal case, releases will include both. 
  * @Benoît will complete the "mechanics" section in the backlog
* "Find your team" section : add links to slack channels
* Software : 
  * development ok, needs to plug on the device to test --&gt; this will be done on wednesday
  * documentation is ongoing, will be ok by the end of the week
  * @lecoued made a huge cleaning of the code
  * next release : unit tests to be implemented
* Activity report : almost done, @benchoufi is on it :\)



## Mechanics

* @Benoit has made a prototype in polystyrene
* Due to mechanical constrains, the section related with one image won't be a perfect plan --&gt; ok for tests, but obviously not for medical applications
* need for transducers to test the encapsulation
