# Preparing next iteration

This section is meant to gather ideas about the objectives for the next iteration :-\)

## Hardware

## Mechanics

* **Bring the probe out of water !**
  * to be completed

## Embedded systems

## Signal processing

* **Find the best choice for envelope extraction**
  * Analog implementation
  * Digital implementation
    * challenge v1 : "dummy" quality assessment --&gt; gather knowledge about state-of-the-art
    * challenge v2 : implement solutions picked from v1 on the device and evaluate image quality, computation time and achievable framerate, ...
  * Decide for good between analog and digital implementations based on image quality and cost constrains
  * Implement the chosen solution on the device

## App - software

* **Store images with their metadata**
