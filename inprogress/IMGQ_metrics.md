# Remarks

* Quantitative metrics are not a silver bullet: some images have parameters that are good for a medical use, but bad for others
     * Information relevant for a case can be stored in what can be noise for another case
* Qualitative review of the images quality has to be done at the first stage - prototyping (Ultrasound Image Quality Assessment: A framework for evaluation of clinical image quality)
