# May 2017 - Ongoing

We're currently finishing the documentation of V3.0.0 release \(available [here](/stable/stable.md)\). 

At the same time, we are gathering ideas in order to prepare next CapTech. During this event, the objectives of V4.0.0 iteration will be decided, and the iteration planning will be fixed. Don't hesitate to add your own recommendations in the dedicated section: [Preparing CapTech.](/inprogress/requirements/preparing-captech.md)
