# Data format

## Description
DICOM (Digital Communications in Medicine) is a standard for handling, storing, transmitting and printing information in medical imaging. It includes a file format definition and 
a network communication protocol. We would like our device to be able to export images in DICOM so that physicians may be able to exchange those 
images or to use already existing specialized software for example. DICOM would also allow consistency in time and a proper tagging for 
images. 
 
 ## Objectives
 There are many DICOM data formats. Some of them were created for X-ray imaging, others were disigned for RMI or ultrasound imaging etc ... And even among those of the latter category, there is till a lot of different formats ! Some of them are adapted for old and basic scanners, others were created for the last generation of ultra poratble ultrasound probes and so on. 
So, the main objective here is to find the DICOM data format(s) that will suit the echOpen probe the best ! There may be several formats as the purpose is to export either fix images (screenshots) or US (cine) videos.
Once the data format is chosen, the second objective os to implement a solution to create such files. 
 
 ## Current solution
 For the moment, we only managed to export JPG images.
