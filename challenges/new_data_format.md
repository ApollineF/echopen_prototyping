# Data format

## Description
DICOM (Digital Communications in Medicine) is a standard for handling, storing, transmitting and printing information in medical imaging. It includes a file format definition and 
a network communication protocol. We would like our device to be able to export images in DICOM so that physicians may be able to exchange those 
images or to use already existing specialized software for example. That format would also allow consistency in time and a proper tagging for 
images.
