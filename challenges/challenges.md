# Challenges

A challenge is a problem encountered in the software development but that isn't related to a specific iteration. This means that anybody can suggest a solution at anytime ! One does not need to join a team to take part to a challenge.

If you want to learn about one of those challenges, just click on the corresponding link and you will find everything you need: a description of the problem, code, ideas, so on and so forth. If have any question or if you think you found something interesting, please contact us !

Here is a list of ongoing challenges :

[GPU & real time processing](/challenges/gpu-and-real-time-processing.md): real time processing is one of the greatest challenges echOpen's software has to face. 

[Scan conversion](/challenges/scan-conersion.md): The signal coming from the transducer, once preprocessed, can be represented by a double array with polar coordinates. But if this array is directly converted into an image (each cell coreesponding to a pixel), a rectangular and distorded image is obtained. Polar to cartesian scan conversion is needed to obtain an image that shows the real shape of organs.

[Data format](/challenges/scan-conversion.md): create an echOpen "open file data format" for all files created with the echOpen kits. It has to be compatible with DICOM, a format commonly used in medical imaging.
