# Get started

Now you're ready to play your part in software/hardware improvements of the echOpen device, you can follow this section's guidelines to set up your own hardware lab and/or get started with the developer version of the software !

This section is divided into two subsections:

[Set up your own echOpen lab](/getstarted/echopen_lab.md): Here you will find a list of the equipment you will need to build the probe and help us with the hardware.

[Hacking guide](/hacking_guide/echopen_lab.md): This section is not yet ready to be published. If you need some help to start contributing on the software development, please [contact one of the software teams](/howto/teams.md).
