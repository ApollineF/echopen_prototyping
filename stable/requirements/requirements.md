Here you can read about the objectives that were fixed for the third iteration. Those objectives were translated in terms of [technical specifications](/stable/recquirements/specifications.md) and [UX design](/stable/recquirements/UX_design.md).

A technical specification is a document that defines a set of requirements that a product must meet or exceed.

User experience design (UX) is the process of enhancing user satisfaction with a product by improving the usability, accessibility, and pleasure provided in the interaction with the product.
