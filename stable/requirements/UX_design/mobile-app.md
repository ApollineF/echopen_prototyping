# add current Mobile app UI

You'll find here the current UI. It is for the moment dead simple. Indeed, for this version, we choose to fix only a one screen app, figuring the main functionalities :





* a splashscreen ;\)
* displaying the image
* set a communication pipeline, enabling the choice between
  * a local mode 
    * displaying a local file 
  * a TCP mode 
    * getting the image sent through TCP protocol. NB : the data are sent via WIFI
  * a UDP mode
    * getting the image sent through UDP protocol
* scrolling with seekBars to control contrast and image intensity
  _Remark: _
  * _contrast can be adjusted by selecting a customized intensity-to-pixels linear or exponential look-up table._
  * _The image intensity can also be amplified uniformally through a gain filter_
