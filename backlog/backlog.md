Here is a synthesis of the technical constrains to be addressed by the device. These ones are deduced from the CapMed that took place on June 18th, 2016.

## Usage 

The device is meant to perform ultrasound imaging. For now, Doppler ultrasonography is out of the scope of the developments. 

The device goes with an app which allows to display the images on a smartphone, and at the same time control some parameters.

To address several medical use cases, 3 transducers with different frequencies (respectively 3.5, 5 and 7.5 mHz) are expected to be incorporated in the probe. Image acquisition will be performed with one transducer at a time.
