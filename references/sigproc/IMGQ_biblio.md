### Evaluation of image quality of ultrasound scanners in medical diagnostics.

* _The evaluation of the properties of ultrasound diagnostic scanners has not yet been standardized. Because the image itself is the basis of diagnostic decisions, it should also be the basis of evaluation of the capabilities of scanners. This study is aimed to help the standardization work by suggesting a procedure for testing the image quality of the scanners._

#### Key learnings

* _Subjective Image Quality Assessment_ vs _Objective Image Quality Assessment_
* Objective Image Quality Assessment:developing quantitative measures that can automatically predict the perceived image quality.

* Between two images: Mean Squared Error
* Single image: Peak Signal to Noise Ratio

Different types of distortions impacting quality:

* Blurred
* Salt-pepper impulsive contaminated image
* Gaussian Noise contaminated Image
* Speckle Noise contaminated Image

Z. Wang proposed a new philosophy assuming that the
human visual system (HVS) is highly adapted to extract
structural information from the visual scene[5]. The new
concept is very different from the previous error sensitivity
philosophy,[5]which considers image degradations as
perceived changes in structural information instead of
perceived errors.
