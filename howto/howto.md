# How to contribute

This section describes the workflow for technical and software developments. It is divided into three subsections:

* [Work methods](/howto/method.md): information about our organization and our iterative workflow.

* [Contribution guide](/howto/contribution_guide.md): we use GitHub to work together. Here is a little guide to learn how to use it.

* [Find your team](/howto/teams.md): a description of our different teams and links to contact them.
